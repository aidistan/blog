Recently, I’ve started building automated workflows for daily works. One of those is to convert PDF-format invoices into JPEG images. It’s easy to achieve with an image library such as ImageMagick, except that a few characters look strange.

{% include figure src='/assets/6a9f5248-7931-4835-aa1d-009c2f132507.png' cap='Pay attention to the “增” character. Its shape in the first line is invalid in Simplified Chinese.' %}

To make the invoices more formal, we should force to use SimSun (宋体), an out fashioned font but still commonly used by government institutions, as default for Simplified Chinese characters.

## Step 1: Install the fonts

1. Open *C:\Windows\Fonts* folder, copy SimSun font to desktop alongside other fonts we may need in the future (such as SimHei, SimKai, SimFang).

1. Install these fonts to Ubuntu: 

1. Refresh font caches: `sudo fc-cache -fv`

1. Check the results: `fc-list :lang=zh-cn | sort`

## Step 2: Set as defaults

Edit */etc/fonts/conf.avail/69-language-selector-zh-cn.conf* to add two lines (marked by `<!-- ADDED -->`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
	<match target="pattern">
		<test name="lang">
			<string>zh-cn</string>
		</test>
		<test qual="any" name="family">
			<string>serif</string>
		</test>
		<edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
			<string>Simsun</string> <!-- ADDED -->
			......
		</edit>
	</match> 
	<match target="pattern">
    <test name="lang">
			<string>zh-cn</string>
		</test>
		<test qual="any" name="family">
			<string>sans-serif</string>
		</test>
		<edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
			<string>SimHei</string> <!-- ADDED -->
			......
		</edit>
	</match> 
	......
</fontconfig>
```

## That‘s it.
