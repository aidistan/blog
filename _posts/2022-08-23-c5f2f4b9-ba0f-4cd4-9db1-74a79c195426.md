Recent ruby versions raise **NameError: uninitialized constant Gem::Source** when initializing a new Rails application by `rails new`, which could be fixed by updating the bundler gem.

## Question

After installing a recent version of Ruby (namely v3.1.2), I encountered a `NameError` when initializing a Rails application by `rails new`.

The backtrace looks like:

```plain
.../bundler/rubygems_ext.rb:18:in `source': uninitialized constant Gem::Source (NameError)

      (defined?(@source) && @source) || Gem::Source::Installed.new
                                           ^^^^^^^^
Did you mean?  Gem::SourceList
        from .../bundler/rubygems_ext.rb:50:in `extension_dir'
        ...
```

## Quick answer

Update the bundler gem using `gem update bundler`.

## Full answer

Rubies recently published were shipped with bundler v2.3.7 which contains a known issue ([rubygems/rubygems#5386](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5386){:target="_blank"}) for autoloading `Gem::Source`.

Now since it has been reproduced and solved, an update of the bundler gem (up to v2.3.9 or newer version) could simply fix it.
